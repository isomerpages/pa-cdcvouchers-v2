Every Singaporean household will receive a total of $300 CDC Vouchers on 3 January 2023.  This is part of the enhanced support under the Assurance Package to help cushion the impact of additional Goods & Services Tax (GST) for Singaporean households and the $1.5 billion Support Package announced in October 2022.  Singaporean households can use the vouchers to purchase goods and services from participating hawkers and heartland merchants as well as participating supermarkets.

On 3 January 2023, every Singaporean household can claim $300 in CDC Vouchers. The value of the vouchers will be allocated equally (i.e., $150 each) to be spent at participating heartland merchants and hawkers, or at participating supermarkets. Singaporean Households have until 31 December 2023 to claim and spend their CDC Vouchers 2023.
