    <label for="accordion1"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#000080">What is the CDC Vouchers Scheme 2023?</span></label>
    <div>
     In January 2023, every Singaporean household can claim $300 in CDC Vouchers. This is part of the enhanced support under the Assurance Package to help cushion the impact of additional Goods &amp; Services Tax (GST) for Singaporean households and the $1.5 billion Support Package announced in October 2022. The value of the vouchers will be allocated equally (i.e., $150 each) to be spent at participating heartland merchants and hawkers, or at participating supermarkets. Singaporean Households have until 31 December 2023 to claim and spend their CDC Vouchers 2023. </div>
