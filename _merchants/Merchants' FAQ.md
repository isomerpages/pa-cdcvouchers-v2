    <div>
    From 3 January 2024, each Singaporean household can claim $500 in CDC Vouchers 2024 digitally at go.gov.sg/cdcv. These vouchers are part of the Government’s continuing efforts to help Singaporean households cope with daily expenses. The vouchers were announced by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Mr Lawrence Wong as part of Budget 2022 and Budget 2023, and additional support from the $1.1 billion Cost-of-Living Package in September 2023.<br><br>
The value of the vouchers will be allocated equally (i.e., $250 each) to be spent at participating heartland merchants and hawkers, or at participating supermarkets. Singaporean Households have until 31 December 2024 to claim and spend their CDC Vouchers 2024.
